# diabetes-patients-readmission

Built supervised learning models to identify high-risk patients and estimate readmission rates using patient data of 10 years
Applied unsupervised techniques like PCA and t-SNE for dimensionality reduction; utilized Random Forest and statistical
tests for feature importance
Addressed class imbalance with SMOTE; tuned hyperparameters for Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forest
Deployed LSTM and LightGBM models using TensorFlow and scikit-learn frameworks; tuned parameters to optimize recall
